DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

I analysed the world’s demographic trends.
I produced a scatterplot illustrating "Birth Rate" and "Internet Usage" statistics by country.
This scatterplot was categorised by Countries' Income Groups.

Second scatterplot illustrates "Birth Rate" and "Internet Usage" statistics by country as well.
However, this scatterplot was categorised by Countries' Regions.
Additional data has been supplied in the form of R vectors which is called CountryRegion_Vectors.R
