Dataset which is called crime_data, contains info on the crimes committed in each of the 50 US states and the percentage of urban population.

To cluster, I tried two techniques: k-means and single-linkage hierarchical clustering. 
After that I compared the results by calculating the Dunn's indices to make a conclusion.
