Trends about Lifespan and Fertility Rate

I produced a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.
The scatterplot was categorised by Countriesâ€™ Regions.

Dataset is for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and I produced a visualisation for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a csv file, some - in R vectors. The csv file contains combined data for both years.
