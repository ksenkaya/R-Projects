FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

There are two vectors of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year.

In this case I calculated the following financial metrics:
- profit for each month
- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit a after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year
