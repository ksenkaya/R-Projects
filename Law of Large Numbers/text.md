Law of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, sdev = 1:

First, I created an R script that counts how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and by divide by the total quantity of N.

As you know that E(X) = 68.2%

And then I checked that Mean(Xn) -> E(X) as I rerun my script while increasing N.
